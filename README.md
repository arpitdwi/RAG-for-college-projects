# Using RAG for college projects
* The objective of this project is to apply RAG to personal data/data unavailable on the internet/recent data and use the power of LLMs to extract important information from them
* Here I have used 3 of my college project reports and used Langchain to build a RAG pipeline to help me recollect important project details effortlessly without going through the entire report
* I've used Cohere Command R Plus as my generative model, Cohere Embeddings and Chroma vector store
* As can be seen in the output of the code I'm able to summarise projects, retrieve key metrics, get the model architecture/implementation details etc. 
* To reproduce the results please specify COHERE_API_KEY in the notebook
